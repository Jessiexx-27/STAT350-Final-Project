# STAT350-Final-Project
Multiple regression analysis-the weight of the fish

Author: Jinxi Liu & Tingxuan Zhang

In this project, we would investigate the factors which have effects on the fish weight. For the dataset in the study, 159 fishesâ€™ data were collected in fish market sales with 7 variables, which were the response variable Weight and the 6 predictors we would like to study. With this dataset, a predictive model can be performed using machine friendly data and estimate the weight of fish can be predicted.

We are interested in building reasonable model between the Weight variable and the different lengths, the height, the width values, the type of fish, then do a prediction on weight.
